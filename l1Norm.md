**Routine Name:**           l1Norm

**Author:** Colby Wight

**Language:** C++

**Description/Purpose:**  This routine will compute the 1 norm for a vector of a given size in the form of a double.

**Input:** The only required input is a vector. The routine will determine the size and do the needed calculations.

**Output:** This routine will output a single double precision number denoting the vector one norm.


**Usage/Example:**

This routine uses a vector for its ease of use as in passing it as a paramter of a function. In this example the vecor passed to this function was a vector containing three elements 1, 2, and 3.
```C++
cout << "l1 Norm: " << l1Norm(vector1) << endl;
```

Output from the lines above:
```C++
      l1 Norm: 6
```
This is the desired result.

**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for l1Norm()
```C++
    double l1Norm(vector<int> &vector1) {
      int sum = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < vector1.size(); i++) {
        sum+= abs(vector1[i]);
      }
      return sum;
    }
```
