## Routine Name: l1Norm(vector<double> &vector1)


Author: Colby

Language: C++

Description/Purpose: This routine will compute the 1 norm for a vector of a given size in the form of a double.

Input: The only required input is a vector. The routine will determine the size and do the needed calculations.

Output: This routine will output a single double precision number denoting the vector norm.

Implementation/Code: The following is the code for l1Norm(vecotr<int>);

double l1Norm(vector<int> &vector1) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < vector1.size(); i++) {
        sum+= abs(vector1[i]);
    }
    return sum;
}

Code: This is a very simple implementation that uses the vector class to easily manipulate the data as if it were in a vector. The magnitude of the elements in the array are simply added together.
